    "# Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives**\n",
    "* Understand the different approaches for data preprocessing in developing ML models\n",
    "* Use Dataflow to perform data preprocessing steps\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook we achieved an RMSE of **3.85**. Let's see if we can improve upon that by creating a data preprocessing pipeline in Cloud Dataflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing data for a machine learning model involves both data engineering and feature engineering. During data engineering, we convert raw data into prepared data which is necessary for the model. Feature engineering then takes that prepared data and creates the features expected by the model. We have already seen various ways we can engineer new features for a machine learning model and where those steps take place. We also have flexibility as to where data preprocessing steps can take place; for example, BigQuery, Cloud Dataflow and Tensorflow. In this lab, we'll explore different data preprocessing strategies and see how they can be accomplished with Cloud Dataflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "One perspective in which to categorize different types of data preprocessing operations is in terms of the granularity of the operation. Here, we will consider the following three types of operations:\n",
    "1. Instance-level transformations\n",
    "2. Full-pass transformations\n",
    "3. Time-windowed aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Dataflow can perform each of these types of operations and is particularly useful when performing computationally expensive operations as it is an autoscaling service for batch and streaming data processing pipelines. We'll say a few words about each of these below. For more information, have a look at this article about [data preprocessing for machine learning from Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/data-preprocessing-for-ml-with-tf-transform-pt1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Instance-level transformations**\n",
    "These are transformations which take place during training and prediction, looking only at values from a single data point. For example, they might include clipping the value of a feature, polynomially expand a feature, multiply two features, or compare two features to create a Boolean flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is necessary to apply the same transformations at training time and at prediction time. Failure to do this results in training/serving skew and will negatively affect the performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Full-pass transformations**\n",
    "These transformations occur during training, but occur as instance-level operations during prediction. That is, during training you must analyze the entirety of the training data to compute quantities such as maximum, minimum, mean or variance while at prediction time you need only use those values to rescale or normalize a single data point. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good example to keep in mind is standard scaling (z-score normalization) of features for training. You need to compute the mean and standard deviation of that feature across the whole training data set, thus it is called a full-pass transformation. At prediction time you use those previously computed values to appropriately normalize the new data point. Failure to do so results in training/serving skew.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Time-windowed aggregations**\n",
    "These types of transformations occur during training and at prediction time. They involve creating a feature by summarizing real-time values by aggregating over some temporal window clause. For example, if we wanted our model to estimate the taxi trip time based on the traffic metrics for the route in the last 5 minutes, in the last 10 minutes or the last 30 minutes we would want to create a time-window to aggreagate these values. \n",
    "\n",
    "At prediction time these aggregations have to be computed in real-time from a data stream."

Note that, in this case we'd have to remember to repeat that prepreprocessing at prediction time to avoid training/serving skew. In general, it is better to use tf.transform which will do this book-keeping for you, or to do preprocessing within your TensorFlow model. We will look at how tf.transform works in another notebook. For now, we are simply moving data from BigQuery to CSV using Dataflow.\n",

    "It's worth noting that while we could read from [BQ directly from TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/cloud/BigQueryReader), it is quite convenient to export to CSV and do the training off CSV. We can do this at scale with Cloud Dataflow. Furthermore, because we are running this on the cloud, you should go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/dataflow) to view the status of the job.
